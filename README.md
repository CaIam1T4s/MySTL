# MySTL
a tiny c++ stl write by myself

functions and classes declarations are from https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/cpp/standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference?view=msvc-170

## Goal
have basic data container like std::array, std::vector, std::list, etc.

other stl tools like std::function std::string, etc.
